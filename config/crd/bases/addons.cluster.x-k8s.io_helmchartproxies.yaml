                  VersionMap is a map of Kubernetes versions to Helm chart versions. This is used to represent a compatibility matrix
                  between Kubernetes versions and Helm chart versions. Both the Kubernetes versions and Helm chart versions can be specified
                  not only as exact versions (i.e. v1.3, v1.3.2) but also as any valid semver range (i.e. >1.3, 1.3.x, 1.3 - 1.4, ^1.2.3, ~1.2.3).

                  Note: version ranges specified using a hyphen (i.e. 1.3 - 1.4) must include a space on either side of the hyphen, 1.3-1.4 will
                  be parsed as release 1.3 with pre-release 1.4.
                  Note: exact versions with patch versions must be specified for OCI charts.

                        If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                        referencing a part of an object.
