# Cluster API Add-on Provider for Helm

### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to CAAPH! Here are some links to help you get started:

- [Quick start guide](./docs/quick-start.md)
- [Development guide](./docs/development.md)
- [Project design outline](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20220712-cluster-api-addon-orchestration.md)

## âœ¨ What is Cluster API Add-on Provider for Helm?

Cluster API Add-on Provider for Helm extends Cluster API by managing the installation, configuration, upgrade, and deletion of cluster add-ons using Helm charts. CAAPH is based on the [Cluster API Add-on Orchestration Proposal](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/main/docs/proposals/20220712-cluster-api-addon-orchestration.md), a larger effort to bring orchestration for add-ons to CAPI by using existing package management tools. 

This project is a concrete implementation of a ClusterAddonProvider, a pluggable component to be deployed on the Management Cluster. An add-on provider component acts as a broker between Cluster API and a package management tool. CAAPH is the first concrete implementation of a ClusterAddonProvider and can serve as a reference implementation.

The aims of the ClusterAddonProvider project are as follows:

#### Goals

- Design a solution for orchestrating Cluster add-ons.
- Leverage the capabilities of existing package management tools, such as an add-on package repository, templating, creation, upgrade, and deletion.
- Make add-on management in Cluster API modular and pluggable.
- Make it clear for developers how to build a Cluster API Add-on Provider based on any package management tool.

#### Non-goals

- Implement a new, full-fledged package management tool in Cluster API.
- Provide a mechanism for altering, customizing, or dealing with single Kubernetes resources defining a Cluster add-on, i.e. Deployments, Services, ServiceAccounts. Cluster API should treat add-ons as opaque components and delegate all the operations impacting add-on internals to the package management tool.
- Expect users to use a specific package management tool.
- Implement a solution for installing add-ons on the management cluster itself.

## ðŸ¤— Community, discussion, contribution, and support

Cluster API Add-on Provider for Helm is developed as a part of the [Cluster API project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api). As such, it will share the same communication channels and meeting as Cluster API.
